# 🛡️ SprintGuard - Proof of Concept

**Predictive Sprint Planning & Risk Mitigation Platform**

SprintGuard is a data-driven platform designed to mitigate estimation failure and scope creep in Agile software development. This Proof of Concept demonstrates the core value proposition: transforming sprint planning from hopeful forecasting into data-driven risk management.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Agile teams face a vicious cycle:
- **Estimation Failure**: Cognitive biases and unclear requirements lead to inaccurate estimates
- **Scope Creep**: Underestimated work makes adding features seem cheap
- **Sprint Chaos**: Overcommitment and mid-sprint additions cause missed deadlines and burnout

SprintGuard breaks this cycle by injecting predictive analytics directly into the planning process.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 📊 Data Health Check
Assesses the quality and quantity of your historical data to set realistic expectations about prediction accuracy.

**Metrics:**
- **Volume Score**: Number of historical stories vs minimum threshold
- **Completeness Score**: Percentage of stories with all required data
- **Quality Score**: Description length and specificity
- **Consistency Score**: Story point distribution patterns
- **Overall Grade**: A-F rating with actionable recommendations

### 2. 🎯 Probabilistic Story Assessor (PSA)
Analyzes new user stories and assigns risk levels based on historical patterns.

**Features:**
- Risk classification: Low, Medium, High
- Confidence scoring (0-100%)
- Detailed explanation of risk factors
- Similar historical stories identification
- **Pluggable Architecture**: Swap algorithms without changing other code

### 3. ⚡ Scope Impact Simulator (SIS)
Models the timeline impact of adding new work to a sprint, making scope creep costs tangible.

**Outputs:**
- Revised sprint end date
- Business days delay
- Impact summary
- Actionable recommendations

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd /home/jovyan/SprintGuard
```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Initialize database** (already done if following this README):
```bash
python3 -c "from src.database import init_database, seed_database_from_json; init_database(); seed_database_from_json()"

## 📊 Sample Data

The PoC includes 140 realistic synthetic stories with the following distribution:
- **High Risk** (20%): API integration, database migration, third-party services
- **Medium Risk** (50%): Standard features with moderate complexity
- **Low Risk** (30%): Simple UI updates, copy changes

The data includes realistic patterns:
- ~17% stories caused sprint spillover
- ~13% were significantly underestimated (actual > 1.5× estimate)

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_health_checker.py
```

## 🔌 Pluggable Risk Assessor Architecture

### For ML Professors / Data Scientists

The Risk Assessor uses a **pluggable architecture** that allows you to swap the assessment algorithm without modifying any other code.

#### Current Implementation
`KeywordRiskAssessor` (V1) - Simple keyword-based heuristics

#### To Add Your ML Model:

1. **Create your implementation** in `src/analyzers/your_assessor.py`:

```python
from src.analyzers.risk_assessor_interface import RiskAssessorInterface, RiskResult

class YourMLAssessor(RiskAssessorInterface):
    def __init__(self, historical_stories):
        super().__init__(historical_stories)
        # Train your model here
        self.model = self.train_model()
    
    def train_model(self):
        # Your ML training logic
        pass
    
    def assess(self, description: str) -> RiskResult:
        # Your prediction logic
        prediction = self.model.predict(description)
        
        return RiskResult(
            risk_level="High",  # or "Medium", "Low"
            confidence=85.0,
            explanation="Your model's explanation",
            similar_stories=[1, 5, 12]  # Optional
        )
```

2. **Swap the implementation** in `app.py` (line ~24):

```python
# Replace this line:
risk_assessor = KeywordRiskAssessor(historical_stories)

# With:
from src.analyzers.your_assessor import YourMLAssessor
risk_assessor = YourMLAssessor(historical_stories)
```

3. **That's it!** The entire application will now use your algorithm.

#### Interface Contract
Your implementation must:
- Inherit from `RiskAssessorInterface`
- Implement `assess(description: str) -> RiskResult`
- Return risk_level as "Low", "Medium", or "High"
- Provide a confidence score (0-100)
- Include a human-readable explanation
